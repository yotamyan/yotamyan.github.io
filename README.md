## 🌟 About Me  
I'm an undergraduate student passionate about combining biology and computational tools to understand complex systems. Currently diving deep into **gene expression and tissue organization** using single-cell data and spatial technologies.

This site is a hub for my coursework, coding projects, and lab work—designed to grow with me over the semester.

---

## 🎓 Current Courses
- 🐍 **Basic Programming Skills (Python)**  
  Working on Python fundamentals and building simple tools to analyze biological data.  
- 📊 **Intro to Statistics**  
  Applying statistical reasoning to experimental design and data interpretation.

---

## 🔬 Current Lab
I'm a student in the **Shalev Itzkovitz Lab** at the Weizmann Institute, exploring cellular polarization across tissues using high-resolution spatial transcriptomics and computational pipelines.

## 🧬 Research Focus
**Project:** *Gene Polarization in the Mouse Kidney*  
Expanding on previous work that mapped apical-basal gene localization in the intestine. I'm currently investigating whether similar polarization patterns exist in kidney tissue. Tools include:
- 🔹 smFISH validation  
- 🔹 scRNA-seq analysis with Seurat  
- 🔹 Tissue segmentation via QuPath
